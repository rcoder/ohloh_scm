		# Progress is reported by yielding [current_step, total_steps] pairs to a provided block.
		#
		# There are two design goals here:
		#
		# First, minimize adminstrator burden. The conversion process is
		# idempotent: if it fails, Ohloh's first recourse is always to try again.
		# For this reason, it is important that multiple pulls do not result in
		# duplicate data. No matter how badly a previous attempt may be screwed up
		# the contents on disk, a second attempt should be able to gracefully
		# resume.
		#
		# Second, maximize compatibility with a wild array of public source control
		# servers.  CVS in particular has a broad spectrum of server capabilities.
		# Therefore, this conversion algorithm is brute-force simplicity itself. We
		# require a minimum number of features: a log feature to get the list of
		# commits, and the checkout feature to get the contents of each commit.
		#
		# The basic idea for conversion is that we sequentially check out each
		# revision from the original repository into a local directory, which also
		# happens to be a local Git repository. As each revision is checked out
		# from the original repository, we commit it into the local Git repository.
		# By walking forward through each commit, we build a Git equivalent to the
		# original repository.
		#
		# It's not fast, but it almost always succeeds.
		#
		# The original commit ID (CVS timestamp or Subversion revision number) is
		# stored in a special file called 'ohloh_token' and checked in as part of
		# each Git commit. This enables us to match code to original source
		# commit, and also enables us to pick up where we left off for incremental
		# updates.
		#
		# Only a single branch from the original repository is converted.
