			# Bug fix (hack) follows.
			#
			# git-whatchanged emits a merge commit multiple times, once for each parent, giving the
			# delta to each parent in turn.
			#
			# This causes us to emit too many commits, with repeated merge commits.
			#
			# To fix this, we track the previous commit, and emit a new commit only if it is distinct
			# from the previous.
			#
			# This means that the diffs for a merge commit yielded by this method will be the diffs
			# vs. the first parent only, and diffs vs. other parents are lost. For Ohloh, this is fine
			# because Ohloh ignores merge diffs anyway.

    # and jump immediately to the second (branch) parent. Our code mistakenly interprets this output
    # as the missing changes relative to the first parent.

    # To avoid this calamity, we must compare the tree hash of this commit with its first parent's.
