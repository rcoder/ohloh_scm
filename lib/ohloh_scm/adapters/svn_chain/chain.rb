					# It is possible for some Subversion commits to include *multiple*
					# renames/copies of a source directory. For example:
					#
					#    A /foo (from /trunk:1)
					#    D /foo/my_branch
					#    A /foo/bar (from /trunk:1)
					#    D /trunk
					#
					# If we simply processed these entries in the order given, then
					# we would conclude that /foo/bar/my_branch has parent
					# /trunk/bar/my_branch (because the first A matches) and exit.
					#
					# This is incorrect! We must look for the *longest* A that matches
					# our path, and follow that one. In the example above, the correct
					# parent for /foo/bar/my_branch is /trunk/my_branch.
					#
					# Therefore, we must sort diffs by descending filename length, so
					# that we choose the longest match.
					c.diffs.sort { |a,b| b.path.length <=> a.path.length }.each do |d|

						# If this diff actually creates this branch, then a parent is impossible.
						# Stop looking for parents.
						#
						# This check exists because of the following complicated commit:
						# http://dendro.cornell.edu/svn/corina/branches/databasing/src/edu/cornell/dendro@813
						# It's long to explain, but basically a directory is renamed and
						# then our branch is created within it, all in a single commit.
						# Without this check, our code mistakenly thinks there is a parent.
