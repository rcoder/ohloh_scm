	# A +Diff+ represents a change to a single file. It can represent the addition or
	# deletion of a file, or it can represent a modification of the file contents.
	# 
	# Ohloh does not track filename changes. If a file is renamed, Ohloh treats this
	# as the deletion of one file and the creation of another.
	# 
	# Ohloh does not track directories, only the files within directories.
	#
	# Don't confuse our use of the word "Diff" with a patch file or the output of the
	# console tool 'diff'. This object doesn't have anything to do the actual contents
	# of the file; it's better to think of this object as representing a single line
	# item from a source control log.
